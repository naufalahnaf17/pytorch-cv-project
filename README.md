# Computer Vision Project

These are some mini projects that I made using Pytorch for computer vision assignments

## cat-and-dogs-classification

in this project, I focused on fine-tune the resnet-50 model then exported it to onnx format.

which initially resnet-50 outputs approximately 1000 classes into just 2 classes according to the dataset that has been downloaded, namely cats and dogs
