# Computer Vision Project

These are some mini projects that I made using Pytorch for computer vision assignments

## cat-and-dogs-classification (Created : 16-09-2024)

in this project, I focused on fine-tune the resnet-50 model then exported it to onnx format.

which initially resnet-50 outputs approximately 1000 classes into just 2 classes according to the dataset that has been downloaded, namely cats and dogs

- Loss : 0.06402150790199812
- Accuracy : 98.46762234305487%
- Epochs : 5

## plant-species-classification (Created : 17-09-2024)

in this project, I focused on fine-tune the google/vit-base-patch16-224 model then exported it to onnx format.

which initially google/vit-base-patch16-224 outputs approximately 1000 classes into just 47 classes according to the dataset that has been downloaded, namely house-plant-species

- Loss : 0.305279920695395
- Accuracy : 93.55418434246046%
- Epochs : 5
